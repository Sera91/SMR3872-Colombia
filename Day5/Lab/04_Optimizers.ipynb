The batch size is not solely related to the available memory for training: a batch size too high will often result in the optimizer getting stuck in bad areas -- indeed, often networks trained with full-batch gradient descent act badly. The **batch size is then another regularizer** and finding its optimal value is dataset- and architecture-dependent. According to the paper above, increasing the batch size as the network approaches a good solution might be a good idea -- I won't take it for granted though, as a lot of research, being based upon experimental proofs, often presents results specific to a given dataset or architecture but depicting them as \"general\"; moreover, _clickbait titles_ are more and more present even for research papers that should instead be based upon humble claims and careful enucleation of limitations.\n"
